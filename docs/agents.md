# Agent Discovery Paths

rolecraft knows where each AI agent looks for skills. When you use a flag like `--claude` or `--cursor`, it installs to the correct directory for that agent.

| Agent       | Directory                                      |

> ⚠️ Windsurf has been rebranded to **Devin Desktop**. The `--windsurf` flag and `~/.windsurf/skills/` path still work for backward compatibility, but new deployments should use `--devin` / `~/.devin/skills/`.

## Install to multiple agents

```bash
rolecraft install ./my-skill --cursor --devin --copilot --gemini --cody
