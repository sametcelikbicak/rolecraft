# Contributing to RoleCraft

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how you can help.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolecraft-sh/rolecraft.git
cd rolecraft
npm install              # also installs the pre-commit hook automatically
npm link                 # now `rolecraft` runs from your local checkout
npm test                 # 1012+ tests should pass
```

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 20. Dev dependencies (Biome, VitePress) install locally but never ship to users — the runtime stays zero-dependency.

## Git Hooks

A `pre-commit` hook runs `npm run lint` before every commit and rejects the commit on lint errors. It is set up **automatically** by `npm install` via the `postinstall` script — no manual `setup-hooks` step is required.

To reinstall or repair the hook manually:

```bash
npm run setup-hooks
```

To bypass the hook once (e.g. for a work-in-progress commit), use `git commit --no-verify` — but CI will still fail the PR if lint errors remain.

## Find Something to Work On

Start with issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/rolecraft-sh/rolecraft/labels/good%20first%20issue) — they are small, self-contained, and perfect for new contributors.

Don't see anything you like? Open a [feature request](https://github.com/rolecraft-sh/rolecraft/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) or ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/rolecraft-sh/rolecraft/discussions).

## Make Changes

- Keep changes focused on a single concern
- Follow existing code style (no semicolons, ES modules, zero-dependency runtime)
- **Business logic** goes in `src/api/`, **CLI output** goes in `src/commands/`
- Add or update tests for any new functionality
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before submitting — both must pass
- To auto-fix formatting and unused imports, run `npm run lint:fix`

## Error Handling

Use `UserError` (from `src/utils/errors.js`) for user-facing errors. It automatically provides helpful suggestions alongside the error message:

```js
import { UserError } from '../utils/errors.js'

// Instead of:
//   throw new Error('Failed to fetch npm package')

// Do:
//   throw new UserError('Could not fetch npm package "foo"', {
//     suggestion: 'Check the package name and your internet connection.',
//     detail: error.message, // shown with --verbose
//     code: 'NPM_FETCH_FAILED',
//   })
```

| Field | Required | Shown | Purpose |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| `message` | yes | always | What went wrong, user-friendly |
| `suggestion` | no | always | What the user should do next |
| `detail` | no | `--verbose` | Technical details for debugging |
| `code` | no | `--verbose` | Machine-readable error code |

Reserve plain `throw new Error(...)` for programming errors (bugs, invariants) that should never reach the user. All user-facing error paths should use `UserError`.

> **Tip:** When adding a new command, always use `UserError` for argument validation errors (missing slug, invalid source, etc.).

## Commit

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new feature
fix: correct bug in parser
docs: update installation guide
chore: bump dependencies
```

## Open a Pull Request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`
2. Write a clear title and description explaining what and why
3. Link any related issues
4. Wait for CI checks to pass (Tests + CodeQL)
5. The repository owner will review and merge
